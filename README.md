# ProjectEulerSolutions
My project euler solutions 

Solutions are in C++ as that is the language I am learning for competitive programming.
May have solutions in Lua (my most comfortable language), Python, or Java depending on whether it's much easier to write in those languages for a solution.
For example, computing with large numbers is a pain in C++ because of the limited storage datatypes versus Python which does it for you.
